/*
The pixels in the input image are represented as integers.
The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way:
Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average 
value of the pixel values from the 3 Ã— 3 square that has its center 
at x, including x itself. All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.

Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
